Mean Calculator

Calculating the central tendency is a common operation in machine learning. 
The central tendency is calculated by the average of a variable, also called mean.

So, the purpose of this code is allow you to enter 3 numbers (exclusively positive),  wich will be submeted to three common types of means calculations:
1. Arithmetic mean - calculated as the sum of the values divided by the total of values;
2. Geometric mean - calculated as the -th root of the product of all values;
3. Harmonic mean - calculated as the number of values divided by the sum of one over each value.

There is a similar exercice in the book "Algoritmos e Programação" written by Afonso Inácio Orth.
